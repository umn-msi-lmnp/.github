# The `lmnp` GitHub Organization

## Our mission statement

We are a team of five bioinformatics analysts at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, supporting both the academic research of the Department of Laboratory Medicine and the clinical work of Fairview’s Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory. We collaborate with principal investigators to analyze large and complex datasets, generating clear, informative, and reproducible results. We value clear communication, honesty in our progress, and a spirit of collaboration. Our goal is to be dependable partners--deeply engaged in the science behind our projects and committed to building pipelines that meet the demands of clinical testing. Above all, we believe that good science comes from working together, sharing knowledge openly, and staying willing to learn and adapt.
